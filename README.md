# Project 5: Public API Requests

* The goal of this project was to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They needed a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other, so we integrated our app with the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and then used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

* We had to independently:
    * Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location
    * Clicking the employee’s image or name had to open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
